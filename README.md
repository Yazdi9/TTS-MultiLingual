## Text To Speech (TTS) With Gradio Plugin 


## Install TTS

```bash
pip install TTS
```

If you plan to code or train models, clone TTS and install it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saba99/TTS-MultiLingual
pip install -e .[all,dev,notebooks]  # Select the relevant extras
```

If you are on Ubuntu (Debian), you can also run following commands for installation.

```bash
$ make system-deps  # intended to be used on Ubuntu (Debian). Let us know if you have a different OS.
$ make install
```

## Synthesizing speech by TTS

### üêç Python API

```python
from TTS.api import TTS

# Running a multi-speaker and multi-lingual model

# List available TTS models and choose the first one
model_name = TTS.list_models()[0]
# Init TTS
tts = TTS(model_name)
# Run TTS
# Since this model is multi-speaker and multi-lingual, we must set the target speaker and the language
# Text to speech with a numpy output
wav = tts.tts("This is a test! This is also a test!!", speaker=tts.speakers[0], language=tts.languages[0])
# Text to speech to a file
tts.tts_to_file(text="Hello world!", speaker=tts.speakers[0], language=tts.languages[0], file_path="output.wav")

# Running a single speaker model

# Init TTS with the target model name
tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/de/thorsten/tacotron2-DDC", progress_bar=False, gpu=False)
# Run TTS
tts.tts_to_file(text="Ich bin eine Testnachricht.", file_path=OUTPUT_PATH)

# Example voice cloning with YourTTS in English, French and Portuguese:
tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/your_tts", progress_bar=False, gpu=True)
tts.tts_to_file("This is voice cloning.", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="en", file_path="output.wav")
tts.tts_to_file("C'est le clonage de la voix.", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="fr-fr", file_path="output.wav")
tts.tts_to_file("Isso √© clonagem de voz.", speaker_wav="my/cloning/audio.wav", language="pt-br", file_path="output.wav")


# Example voice conversion converting speaker of the `source_wav` to the speaker of the `target_wav`

tts = TTS(model_name="voice_conversion_models/multilingual/vctk/freevc24", progress_bar=False, gpu=True)
tts.voice_conversion_to_file(source_wav="my/source.wav", target_wav="my/target.wav", file_path="output.wav")

# Example voice cloning by a single speaker TTS model combining with the voice conversion model. This way, you can
# clone voices by using any model in TTS.

tts = TTS("tts_models/de/thorsten/tacotron2-DDC")
tts.tts_with_vc_to_file(
    "Wie sage ich auf Italienisch, dass ich dich liebe?",
    speaker_wav="target/speaker.wav",
    file_path="ouptut.wav"
)

# Example text to speech using [Coqui Studio](https://coqui.ai) models. You can use all of your available speakers in the studio.
# [Coqui Studio](https://coqui.ai) API token is required. You can get it from the [account page](https://coqui.ai/account).
# You should set the `COQUI_STUDIO_TOKEN` environment variable to use the API token.

# If you have a valid API token set you will see the studio speakers as separate models in the list.
# The name format is coqui_studio/en/<studio_speaker_name>/coqui_studio
models = TTS().list_models()
# Init TTS with the target studio speaker
tts = TTS(model_name="coqui_studio/en/Torcull Diarmuid/coqui_studio", progress_bar=False, gpu=False)
# Run TTS
tts.tts_to_file(text="This is a test.", file_path=OUTPUT_PATH)
# Run TTS with emotion and speed control
tts.tts_to_file(text="This is a test.", file_path=OUTPUT_PATH, emotion="Happy", speed=1.5)

```

### Command line `tts`
#### Single Speaker Models

- List provided models:

    ```
    $ tts --list_models
    ```
- Get model info (for both tts_models and vocoder_models):
    - Query by type/name:
       
        For example:

        ```
        $ tts --model_info_by_name tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts
        ```
        ```
        $ tts --model_info_by_name vocoder_models/en/ljspeech/hifigan_v2
        ```
    
       
- Run TTS with default models:

  For example:

    ```
    $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --model_name "tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts" --out_path output/path/speech.wav
    ```

#### Multi-speaker Models


- Run your own multi-speaker TTS model:

    ```
    $ tts --text "Text for TTS" --out_path output/path/speech.wav --model_path path/to/model.pth --config_path path/to/config.json --speakers_file_path path/to/speaker.json --speaker_idx <speaker_id>
    ```
